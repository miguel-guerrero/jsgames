## Introduction

This directory implements the classic `breakout` game with pure vanilla Javascript (no external dependencies)
using a `canvas` element.

## Quick Start

For local testing run:

    $ ./serve.sh

Will create a simple python web server to provide access to `index.html` to a web browser

Open the following path:

    http://localhost:8000

To play!
